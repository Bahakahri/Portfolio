## About Me

Data scientist/data analyst passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights. Skilled in Python, R, and data visualization. Eager to tackle new challenges and collaborate.

## Projects

### Project 1: Data-Driven Analysis of Mortality Rates and YLL with Python: Collaborative Medical Study

<a href="https://ibb.co/f1C5Mcy"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1v95ZSP/Captuere.png" alt="Captuere" border="0"></a> <!-- Replace with your project image URL -->
- **Description:**<br /> ‚Ä¢ Collaborated with a medical professional to conduct an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive death
certificate database, encompassing crucial data such as the date of decease, causes of death, and
comprehensive individual information.<br />
‚Ä¢ Engineered a Python codebase for the systematic transformation of raw database data into insightful
metrics, calculating potential years of life lost (PYLL), and effectively presenting these critical findings in
a visually compelling Excel file.<br />
‚Ä¢ Methodically analyzed the acquired data to derive comprehensive results, encompassing the primary
determinants of mortality rates and the principal contributors to potential years of life lost (PYLL) across
various age cohorts.
- **Technologies Used:** Data Analysis,Python,Data Transformation,Metrics,Data Visualization,Excel,Statistical Analysis, Healthcare,Database Management.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Project Repository](https://github.com/Bahakahri/YLLUNFPA)
